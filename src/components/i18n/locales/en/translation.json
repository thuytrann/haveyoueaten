The customer receives the RUT deduction directly on the invoice and thus pays the price shown above after the RUT deduction.

  "s5c1p10": "Reliable and flexible 🌸 have recommended her to several friends as she is extremely professional and the cleaning is always top notch! 👌🏻",
  "s5c1p11": "I can warmly recommend Aleksandra Cislowski Städfirma!",

  "s5c1p13": "My husband and I both work full time and we both agreed that we would hire cleaning help for about two days in a month. Like so many others, however, we thought it was a big step to let a stranger be alone in our apartment for several hours. We were also both a little suspicious about the cleaning industry in general considering that the industry is notorious for its poor conditions and many times it has come to light that vulnerable people have been exploited in a way that is not dignified. Fortunately, we have been lucky enough to come into contact with Aleksandra and her company. Aleksandra speaks fluent English (she is learning Swedish) so communication has never been a problem and best of all, she seems to enjoy her profession. She has a fantastic ability to know her customer and come up with opinions and housewife tips on e.g. which chemicals and cleaning equipment should be purchased. It is certainly possible to find a slightly cheaper alternative, but for those who appreciate trust and professionalism and want to be sure that the business is honest, my husband and I can warmly recommend Aleksandra 🌸",
